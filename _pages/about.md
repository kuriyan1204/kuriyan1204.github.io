I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the [TohokuNLP group](https://www.nlp.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/). My research interests lie broadly at the intersection of NLP and ML. Additionally, I'm a founding ML engineer at [Kotoba Technologies](https://www.kotoba.tech), where I build audio foundational models. I was a Software Engineer Intern at Apple in Summer 2024, working on NLP-related projects.
