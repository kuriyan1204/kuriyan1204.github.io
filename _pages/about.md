I'm a Ph.D. student and [JSPS research fellow (DC1)](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-pd/) at [TohokuNLP group](https://www.nlp.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/). I am also a software engineer intern at Apple in Tokyo. I'm interested in efficient LM training/inference/deployment and their underlying principles.

I was previously a founding ML engineer at [Kotoba Technologies](https://www.kotoba.tech), where I worked on building [simultaneous translation app](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/同時通訳-リアルタイム音声翻訳の新境地/id6740851285). Also, I was a software engineer intern at Apple in Cupertino, where I worked on NLP related projects for [Apple Intelligence](https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/).
